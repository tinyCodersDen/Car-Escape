# Car-Escape
Hello, This is the Tinycoder repo for my car escape game.
You would have seen that my Car_Escape.py might have had png/image.png, but that was just my directory for the game.
Please check out the video of my channel in where I explain the game in more detail.
Here is the link to my channel where I have my video: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcYaT59XcMxI9X3UDlVkZDA

Happy Coding!
